When you're good at a hobby, that turned into a job... You forget that you used to _perform said hobby_ **for fun**;  for no reason besides that. Remind yourself what that feels like. Sometimes, all we need is a little momentum - to explore what we love, grow on a personal-level, and potentially be better, professionally.

For instance, I used to develop websites. I had a [Xanga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanga). I hardly, if ever, posted a thing (this is officially my longest post ever); but I absolutely loved changing the way it looked _every few days_. I've built a variety of personal websites for teachers, landing pages for a variety of industries and events. But easily been 5 years since I've done anything of the sort... So I made this.

This small, stupid little thing propelled me into an idea for my own app. It got me to update an old app.  It got me to create a very small "nano"-service just so that I could practice writing a bunch of tests.

Sometimes, all we need is a little momentum.
